## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Emerald Green (#19c856) for accents, buttons, and icons, reflecting the brand's innovative approach. Use it sparingly to draw attention to calls to action and key information.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222). A near-black color provides a high-tech feel.
- Accent color: Blue-green (#19a8c8). It is analogous to the primary, but lighter and more saturated.
- Body text: 'Inter' for a clean, modern and highly readable design.
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk', which pairs well with 'Inter', creating a sense of contemporary professionalism.
- Use clean, line-based icons that complement the overall minimalist design. Ensure icons are consistent and reflect the 'AI' theme where applicable.
- Implement a fully responsive, mobile-first layout using Tailwind CSS. Ensure the site is accessible and user-friendly on all devices.
- Incorporate subtle entrance animations powered by Framer Motion to create a smooth and engaging user experience. Animations should be AI-themed and not overwhelming.
